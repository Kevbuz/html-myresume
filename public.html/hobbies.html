I love everything football- playing, watching, analysing or what have you once it is football. 
Being infront of my screen all day long dhould be added as a hobby cos i do that a lot. 
I'm not rally a fan of movie however i still enjoy few times i have tried but not reallya freaky fan of movies. 
Used to love wresting but no longer as strong as it used to be. I also love trying new things out and love travelling around.
